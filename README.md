# Data Visualization with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib

Welcome to this introductory project on data visualization using Python libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. This project is designed to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of visualizing data for analysis and presentation.

## Project Overview

In this notebook, you will learn:
- **Data Manipulation**: Using NumPy and Pandas to handle and process data.
- **Basic Plotting**: Creating various plots such as line, bar, and scatter plots with Matplotlib.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Customizing plots, adding labels, titles, and legends to make the data more readable and visually appealing.

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have the following packages installed:
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

You can install these dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
